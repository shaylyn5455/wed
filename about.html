    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <p>Environmental advocacy and conservation refer to efforts aimed at protecting, preserving, and restoring the
        natural environment. This work often involves raising awareness about environmental issues, such as pollution,
        deforestation, climate change, and biodiversity loss. Advocates push for policy changes, sustainable practices,
        and responsible stewardship of natural resources. Conservation efforts focus on the protection of ecosystems,
        wildlife, and natural habitats through activities like reforestation, wildlife preservation, and the
        establishment of protected areas. These initiatives can be driven by individuals, non-profits, governments, or
        international organizations, all working to ensure a healthier planet for future generations.<p>
